# About

Welcome to my sandbox!

After several attempts of moving my development environment to the cloud, I created this repository as an attempt to keep my personal development environment in a single place. The advent of tools like [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) and [Github Code Spaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) allowed me to consolidate my local environment setup in a single git repo.

Inside this repo you can find:

- Basic services ready to use: Postgress, Redis, nginx, elasticsearch, kibana (WIP)
- Programming Languages ready to use: ruby, go, C/C++ (WIP)
- [Coding Interviews](#coding-interviews) I've done in the past
- [Leetcode](#leetcode-solutions) and [HackerRank](#hackerrank-solutions) solutions I've created
- Other sample code and test code I've created
